            <p class="lead">Automatic File Manager is a .Net based software that automates file operations on a local PC. Usually,
                managing each & every file in a directory is a hectic job and consumes a significant amount of time,
                Especially if the no of files is more. It is a tool through which a user can assign rules based on constraints
                like file extension, filename, file size and last date of modification...etc. and perform operations such as
                copying, moving, renaming and deleting temporarily or permanently.</p>

            <p class="lead">DLS is custom built for use in Railways. The system continuously monitors the
                various signaling activities and parameters in a Railway Station/End Cabin
                Yard/Wayside relay huts. Its architecture is useful for both distributed and
                centralized monitoring of the requirements.
                The system works in a dedicated manner by keeping an eagle eye on the
                various activities that take place in a Railway signaling system and records
                the field activities in chronological order with real time stamp, thus making
                easy, a manually impossible task of recording the events of signaling system.
                These recorded information/data is greatly useful for PREDICTIVE
                MAINTENANCE and FAULT ANALYSIS.</p>
